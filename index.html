                                                The Project Managers were amazing! They always responded to my text messages and phone calls! The crew was prompt each day and were very professional and organized while working on a 5 day project!
                                                The finished product was so much more than we expected! Living in Houston, you try to stay away from being outdoors if you can! Now our family LOVES being outside! Thanks again New Gen!”

Very honest and professional. The 3D rendering we were provided was exactly what we got. We were in constant communication every step of the way. My parents also had a patio cover built at the same time for their house next door as well and couldn't be happier with the work and quality. Definitely going to recommend them to friends and family.”

                        <p>Our Aluminum cover patios offer several advantages over wooden patios. First, they are more durable and resistant to weather elements, meaning they won't warp, crack, or rot over time. Second, aluminum requires minimal maintenance, eliminating the need for regular staining or sealing. Additionally, aluminum patios have superior fire resistance, making them a safer option for outdoor living spaces. Lastly, they provide superior energy efficiency, as they reflect heat and help keep outdoor spaces cooler, making them a practical and long-lasting choice for homeowners.</p>

                        <p>At New Gen Patio, safety is one of our top priorities. Our patios are engineered to withstand an average wind resistance of 140 mph, with the capability to hold up to 170 mph, while guaranteeing a minimum of 120 mph by contract-equivalent to Hurricane T3 winds.

                            Before starting any project, we always inspect the area where we will install your patio or pergola to ensure optimal conditions. We achieve durability by securely anchoring our structures to concrete using robust systems and building a strong inner foundation for enhanced stability. Each project undergoes thorough engineering calculations to ensure we meet or exceed wind resistance standards. This commitment ensures your outdoor space is not only beautiful but also resilient against the elements."</p>
